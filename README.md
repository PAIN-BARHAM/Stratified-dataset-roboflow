# Stratified-dataset-roboflow

- Simply, this notebook will guide you on creating a stratified dataset that has been created using [Roboflow website](https://roboflow.com/). 

The purpose of use: 

- I created this to get a stratified dataset for this [dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/rgb-arsl/rgb-arabic-alphabet-sign-language-aasl-dataset). The result is shared as well [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/rgb-arabic-alphabet-sign-language-object-detection-dataset/rgb-arabic-alphabet-sign-language-object-detection-dataset).
